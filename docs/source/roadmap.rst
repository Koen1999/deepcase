Roadmap
=======

This part of the documentation keeps track of desired features in future releases.

- Create :py:class:`DeepCASE` wrapper class that combines the functionality of :ref:`ContextBuilder` and :ref:`Interpreter` (and perhaps :ref:`Preprocessor`)

Nice to haves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Features that are listed here would be nice to have for DeepCASE.
I probably won't implement them myself, but feel free to send me a pull request.

- None at the moment
